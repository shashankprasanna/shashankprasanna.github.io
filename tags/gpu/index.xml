&lt;p&gt;An AI accelerator is a dedicated processor designed to accelerate machine learning computations. Machine learning, and particularly its subset, deep learning is primarily composed of a large number of linear algebra computations, (i.e. matrix-matrix, matrix-vector operations) and these operations can be easily parallelized. AI accelerators are specialized hardware designed to accelerate these basic machine learning computations and improve performance, reduce latency and reduce cost of deploying machine learning based applications.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>AI Accelerators and Machine Learning Algorithms: Co-Design and Evolution</title><link>/ai-accelerators-and-machine-learning-algorithms-co-design-and-evolution/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/ai-accelerators-and-machine-learning-algorithms-co-design-and-evolution/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;If you told me a few years ago that data scientists would be using Docker containers in their day to day work, I wouldn’t have believed you. As a member of the broader machine learning (ML) community I always considered Docker, Kubernetes, Swarm (remember that?) exotic infrastructure tools for IT/Ops experts. Today it’s a different story, rarely a day goes by when I don’t use a Docker container for training or hosting a model.
An attribute of machine learning development that makes it different from traditional software development is that it relies on specialized hardware such as GPUs, Habana Gaudi, AWS Inferentia to accelerate training and inference. This makes it challenging to have containerized deployments that are hardware-agnostic, which is one of the key benefits of containers. In this blog post I’ll discuss how Docker and container technologies have evolved to address this challenge.

You can also select instances with different vCPUs (core thread count), system memory and network bandwidth and add a range of storage options (object storage, network file systems, block storage, etc.) — in summary, you have options.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
