In the past decade, I&amp;rsquo;ve had the very good fortune of working for companies that make some of the best and proven developer productivity tools. If you&amp;rsquo;re an engineer who&amp;rsquo;s built control systems for rockets, cars or robots you&amp;rsquo;ve used MATLAB and Simulink. If you&amp;rsquo;re an AI developer you likely have an NVIDIA GPU at arm&amp;rsquo;s reach (ssh to AWS EC2 counts as arm&amp;rsquo;s reach). If you&amp;rsquo;re a developer running software in production you&amp;rsquo;ve likely relied on AWS services for their scalability and and reliability for deployment. If you&amp;rsquo;re an AI researcher there is no better tool than PyTorch to go from research paper to trained model.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
